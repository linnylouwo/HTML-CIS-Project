<h2>Women in the Arts</h2>
	<hr>
	
	<div id="HomeDiv2">
	<p id="Pmargin0">Since before recorded history women have been making art. In fact, Virginia Hughes, author of "Were the First
		Artists Mostly Women?" in <i>National Georgraphic magazine</i> referenced a study that estimates approximately three-quarters 
		of the handprints seen in the "oldest-known cave art" were left by females, suggesting that most of those works of art were created
		by women. </p>
	<p>Hughes quotes archaeologist Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University, who states, "There has been a male bias in the literature for
		a long time. People have made a lot of unwarranted assumptions about who made these things, and why."</p>
	<p>Unfortunatley, the male bias in the art world has not changed much over time. Pick up any art history book and you'll find it filled with male artists, 
	   while the contribution of female artists to the art world is downplayed. Ask anyone, not directly related to the art world, to name a famous artist 
	   and most people will reply with someone like Rembrandt, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh, or Pablo Picasso. All men. On rare occasions, someone may mention Frida Kahlo 
	   or Georgia O'Keeffe, who are the only two female artists in history to receive a small portion of the fame that these acclaimed male artists have received. 
	   In fact, if you seach the phrase, "famous female artists" in a web browser you'll likely find that you haven't heard of any of them except the two artists mentioned above.</p>
	<p>Although women have created art for as long as men have, it is an unfortunate fact, that due to a history of the supression of women's rights, and the limited options women 
		have had until recently, it is doubtful that historical female artists will ever be credited with their fair share of the recognition due to them. </p>
	<p> In consideration of these facts, I have created this website to shed some light on artists who may otherwise never be known to the general public. </p>
	<p>While the artists contained in these pages are a very small sample of the woman artists and art movements that have existed in the past hundred or so years, 
		it is my hope that, inspired by the information and art contained in these pages, you will research some of these women and find out more about them and 
		their fellow female artists. </p>
	<p>Additionally, to give recognition to modern women artists, I have created the slideshow seen below. There you'll find examples of the works of 
	   Christi Belcourt, the Guerrilla Girls (the billboard), Katharina Cibulka, Jaime McCartney, Lin Tianmiao, and Yayoi Kusama. </p>
	<p>It is my hope that you find the information contained in this website thought-provoking and that you continue to explore the lives and works of female artists everywhere. </p>
