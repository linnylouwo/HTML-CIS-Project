<h3 class="Apar">The Movement</h3>

<p class="Apar">
The Art Deco movement was popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The term Art Deco 
is a shortened version of arts decoratifs, taken from the title of the 1925 World’s 
Fair, the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, held 
in Paris, France.  Art Deco combined art and craftsmanship and is seen mostly in 
architecture, textile, furniture, and fashion. The style is characterized by geometric 
shapes, zigzag forms, and clean lines. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
Although often compared to Art Nouveau, Art Deco is a design movement inspired by 
industrialization and technical progress and incorporates symmetrical geometric 
patterns and bright colors in a variety 
of modern materials, whereas Art Nouveau is more focused on the natural environment.

		<h2>Tamara de Lempicka (1898-1980)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>Tamara de Lempicka was a Polish painter born in Warsaw on May 16, 1898. At the time, Warsaw was part of what was known as 
			the Congress Kingdom of Poland, an area of the Russian Empire.  
		</p>
		<p>In 1916, Lempicka married Tadeusz Lempicki, a prominent Polish lawyer, who was arrested during the Russian Revolution in 1917 by the secret police. Lempicki was 
			able to secure his release by offering the Swedish 
			consul her favors. The couple then fled the country and eventually moved to Paris. 
		</p>
		<p>Lempicka studied art at the Academie de la Grandee Chaumiere and, by 1925, had her first solo exhibition in Milan. She is best known for her highly stylized and 
			brightly colored portraits of aristocrats and female nudes. 
			In 1928, Lempicka divorced her husband and became the mistress of baron Raoul Kuffner.  Once Kuffner’s wife died in 1933, he 
			married Lempicka and she was then known in the press as “The Baroness with a Brush.”
		</p>
		<p>In 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, she and her husband moved to the United States, where she continued her work, painting portraits of celebrities, 
			still lives, and abstracts. 
		</p>
		<p>Lempicka died in 1980 in Mexico and had her ashes scattered over the Popocatepeti volcano.
