<h3 class="Apar">The Movement</h3>

<p class="Apar">
Originally called propaganda art, the Pop Art movement emerged in the mid-1950s in 
Britain and in the late 1950s in the United States. A group of artists in Britain, 
calling themselves the Independent Group, were the first artists to create pop art works. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
It is characterized by bright, flat colors and recognizable images, 
often drawn from popular media and products.

		<h2>Evelyne Axell (1935-1972)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>Evelyne Axell was born in 1935 in Belgium. Although her initial course of study in the Namur 
			School of Art was ceramics, in 1954 she changed her major to drama and began a career as an actress.  
			In 1956 she married Belgian film director Jean Antoine. They moved to Paris in 1959 so Axell could 
			pursue a more serious acting career. While in Paris she performed in theatrical and televised plays, 
			but eventually decided to move back to Belgium to star in several movies. 
		</p>
		<p>In 1964, Axell decided to quit her acting career to pursue a career in art and studied under the tutelage 
			of Surrealist painter Rene Magritte. When her husband created a series of documentaries featuring Pop Art, 
			Axell became enchanted with the style and began to create her own Pop Art pieces.  She is best known for her 
			psychedelic, erotic paintings, self-portraits on Plexiglas, and her “erotomobiles”, the erotic depictions of 
			women in cars. Her work embodied themes of female sexuality and feminism, civil rights, and environmentalism. 
		</p>
		<p>Due to the criticism and dismissal she received from the male-dominated artworld, she began to sign her painting 
			with just her last name to try to downplay her gender, with the hope that her art would be taken more seriously.
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, Axell’s life was cut short when she died in an automobile accident in Belgium, at the age of 37, 
			just eight years after she began her career in art.
