<h3 class="Apar">The Movement</h3>

<p class="Apar">
Art Nouveau, which literally translates to “new art”, can trace its history 
to two earliest artistic influences, the Arts and Crafts movement and Japanese art.  
The term was taken 
from the Parisian art gallery owned by Samuel Bing, the Maison de L’Art Nouveau. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
 It flourished between the years of 1890 and 1910 and was used in all forms of design, including architecture, furniture, product 
 design, fashion, and graphics.  Defining characteristics of the Art Nouveau style 
 are organic motifs, plant-like embellishments, female forms, and flowing curved lines.

		<h2>Gerda Wegener (1886-1940)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>Gerda Wegener was born in Grenaa, Denmark in 1886. She studied art at the Royal 
			Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen when she was a teenager. While there, 
			she met and married a fellow art student at an adjoining college, Einar Wegener. 
		</p>
		<p>Wegener is known for her paintings of beautiful women, often in seductive poses, 
			and sometimes engaged in sexual activities. Some of her more daring works were 
			classified as lesbian erotica and published in illicit art books. One of the highlights 
			of her career was when she won three metals for her paintings, two gold and one bronze, 
			at the 1925 World’s Fair in Paris. She was also an illustrator and created illustrations 
			for fashion magazines such as Vogue, La Vie Parisienne, and Fantasio.  She even created 
			anti-German illustrations for magazines Le Matin and La Baionnette during World War II. 
		</p>
		<p>The legacy of Gerda Wegener’s life and work has been overshadowed by her famous husband, 
			who inspired the 2015 movie, <i>The Danish Girl</i>, the story of Einar Wegener’s life as a transgender 
			individual living in the early 20th century. In 1904, when one of her models didn’t show up for a sitting, Wegener asked 
			her husband to pose. Adopting the alter ego of “Lili”, Einar Wegener soon became Wegener’s favorite model 
			and eventually identified as a male-to-female transgender individual. 
		</p>
		<p>For Einar Wegener to have gender reassignment surgery, the couple had to obtain an annulment, as same-sex marriage was not legal in 
			Denmark at the time. Their divorce became official in 1930, and tragically, Lili Wegener died 
			in 1931 due to complications during the fifth of her gender reassignment surgeries. 
		</p>
		<p>In 1931, Wegener married diplomat Major Fernando Porta and moved to Morocco, but her marriage didn’t last long.  
			Divorced in 1936, Wegener returned to Denmark in 1938 and held her last exhibition in 1939. Although the early 
			days of her life were spent surrounded by friends, fellow artists, and other artistic individuals, Wegener spent 
			the last years of her life quietly, drinking heavily and facing financial hardships. Having had no children, when 
			she died in obscurity in 1940, just after Nazi Germany invaded Denmark, and her small estate was auctioned off.  
			Once a well-known and notorious figure, the only acknowledgement of her passing was a small obituary in the local paper.
