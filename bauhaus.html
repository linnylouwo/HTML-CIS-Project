<p class="Apar">
The Staatliches Bauhaus, otherwise known as the Bauhaus ("building house" in German), was 
founded by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar, Germany. It operated in Weimar until 1925, when
it was moved to the city of Dessau. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
The Bauhaus believed in the unity of artists and craftsman and made no distinction between
fine and applied arts. Its style features simple geometric shapes, without elaborate decorations. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
The original concept for the Bauhaus was that of the medieval Bauhutte: master, journeyman, and apprentice. 
The school had a multitude of workshops, including stained glass, wood, metal, weaving, 
print, ceramics, and glass. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
Although more than half of the students at the school were
women and the founders claimed to welcome all students, no matter the gender, most of the 
women were relegated to the weaving workshop. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
The Bauhaus operated in the city of Dessau from 1925 until 1932 and in Berlin from 1932 until
it closed its doors in 1933 under pressure froom the Nazi regime. However, many of the staff and students
fled Germany and spread the Bauhaus design concept throughout the world.

		<h2>Friedl Dicker-Brandeis (1898 - 1944)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>Friedl Dicker was born into a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria on July 30, 1898. She studied under Johannes Itten, 
			a Swiss expressionist painter, at his private school and, eventually, followed him to the German school of design, Bauhaus, in the city of Weimar.  
			From 1919 to 1923, Dicker-Brandeis worked in the textile, printmaking, book binding, and typography workshops at the Bauhaus. 
			During the 1920s to mid-1930s she worked in various areas of art and design, including interior design, textiles, and theater design. 
			In the early 1930s, Dicker-Brandeis became active in politics and was briefly imprisoned for communist activities in 1934. After her release, 
			she traveled to Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic) and met and married her maternal cousin, Pavel Brandeis and subsequently changed her name to Friedl Dicker-Brandeis.  
		</p>
		<p>When the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia began in 1938, Dicker-Brandeis was able to secure a passport to Palestine, but since her husband was unable to obtain one, 
			she decided to stay with him, despite the danger of living as a Jewish woman in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia. 
			In 1942, at 44 years of age, Dicker-Brandeis and her husband were deported to the Jewish ghetto of Terezin, located 30 miles north of Prague. 
			Although Nazi propaganda films depicted the ghetto as an attractive and happy place to live, Terezin was actually a typical Jewish ghetto of the Nazi era, 
			filled with deprivation, fear, and death. Through forced labor and crowded, unhealthy living conditions, 33,000 Jews died from disease and starvation. 
			However, unlike most other Jewish ghettos, the citizens were able to create an arts community and prisoner-led education system.  Using art supplies she 
			brought with her when she was forced into Terezin, Dicker-Brandeis gave the children of the ghetto art lessons and helped them to cope with the uncertainty 
			and hardships of ghetto life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pavel Brandeis was transported to Auschwitz in 1944. In order to join him, Dicker-Brandeis volunteered to be transported to Auschwitz in the next available transport. 
			Before leaving Terezin, she gave Raja Englanderova, the chief tutor at the dormitory, the Girls’ Home L410, two suitcases filled with 4500 drawings created by the 
			children of Terezin. After the war, Willy Groag, the director of the Girls’ Home L410, brought the suitcases to the Jewish community in Prague. 
			Friedl Dicker-Brandeis was killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, along with 550 out of the 660 of the youthful artists whose work was preserved in two suitcases by 
			Dicker-Brandeis. The drawings are now in the Jewish Museum in Prague’s collection.
