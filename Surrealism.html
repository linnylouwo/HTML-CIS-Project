<h3 class="Apar">The Movement</h3>

<p class="Apar">
In 1924, surrealism emerged into the art and literary worlds of Paris. 
Andre Breton, a poet, and the founder of surrealism, wrote in his Surrealist 
Manifesto, “Surrealism, noun, masc. pure psychic automatism by which it is 
intended to express, either verbally or in writing, the true function of thought.”
</p>
<p class="Apar">
Surrealism art is characterized by dream-like scenes, unexpected and often 
illogical images, 
and bizarre combinations of ordinary objects, animals, and people.

		<h2>Dorothea Tanning (1910-2012)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>Dorothea Tanning was a self-taught artist, born in Illinois in 1910. She graduated from 
			Galesburg Public High School in 1926 and went on to spend two years in Knox College from 1928 until 1930, 
			when she quit school to pursue a career in art. In 1935, she moved to New York City where she worked 
			as a commercial artist while pursuing her passion for painting in her spare time. 
		</p>
		<p>In 1941 she was introduced to Julien Levy, a gallery owner in New York, who, impressed by her work, 
			offered to show her paintings. Levy gave Tanning two solo exhibitions in 1944 and 1948.  During this time, 
			she was introduced to other Surrealist artists, including German painter Max Ernst, whom she later married. 
			In 1949, the couple moved to France, where they lived until Ernst’s death in 1976. 
		</p>
		<p>Tanning returned to New York after the death of her husband and continued to create art until the 1980s, 
			when she turned her artistic endeavors to writing and poetry. She continued her writing 
			career throughout the 1990s and 2000s, until her death in 2012, at the age of 101. 
		</p>
		<p>Tanning had a long and enduring artistic career and experimented with a multitude of mediums. 
			From writing to painting to creating three-dimensional works of soft sculpture, she excelled at every artform she tried.
