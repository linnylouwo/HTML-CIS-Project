<h3 class="Apar">The Movement</h3>

<p class="Apar">
The dada art and literary movement began in 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland.  
It resulted from the artists’ negative reaction to the horrors of World War I 
and rejected militarism, monarchy, and traditional forms of artistic expression, 
such as painting and sculpture. Dadaists rejected all tradition and strived for 
complete freedom. Dada spread from Zurich to other European countries, including 
Germany, where dada artists used the medium to target the 
Nazi party and politics, which earned many of the Dadaists persecution from the Nazis. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
The Dadaists have taken credit for developing the art medium of the photomontage. 
Hannah Hoch was one of the first dada artists to elevate the art form by cutting, 
overlapping, and juxtaposing photos 
and photo fragments in meaningful ways, to create a story and relay her message. 
</p>
<p class="Apar">
The origin of the term dada is unclear as many different stories of the origin exist. 
One version claims that one of the artists opened a French 
dictionary and randomly selected the word dada, which means hobbyhorse in French.

		<h2>Hannah Hoch (1889-1978)</h2>
		<div id="div2">
		<p>
		Hannah Hoch was a German artist born in the city of Gotha in 1889. In her youth she studied 
		art under the tutelage of various artists, including glass designer Harold Bergen and Emil Orlik. 
		In 1915, Hoch began an intimate relationship with a pioneering member of the Berlin dada movement, 
		Raoul Hausmann. Although a part of the dada world herself, some claim that her relationship with Hausmann 
		was the deciding factor on her admittance to and acceptance by the mostly male German dada group. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Hoch displayed her artwork with fellow dada artists in the 1920 First International Dada Fair.  
		However, the only reason she was allowed to participate was that Hausmann refused to show his work 
		unless Hoch was included. Unfortunately, however supportive Hausmann was of her work during their relationship, 
		in his memoirs he wrote that she was “never a member of the club.”
		</p>
		<p>
		The male Dadaists claimed to support women’s emancipation and their freedom to create art in a man’s world, 
		but the treatment their female compatriots received was often patronizing and superior.  In fact, Hans Richter, 
		a German dada artist, once described Hoch’s contribution to the movement as the “sandwiches, beer and coffee she 
		managed somehow to conjure up despite the shortage of money.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Hoch was known for and received critical acclaim for her political collages and photomontages, 
		where she collected and combined images and text from mass media to make statements about popular culture, 
		the German government, and the roles of woman. She is quoted as saying, “there are 
		no limits to the materials available for pictorial collages – above all they can be found in photography, 
		but also in writing and printed matter, even in waste products.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Although banned from exhibiting her work during the Nazi regime, she remained in Germany throughout WWII, 
		and began exhibiting again after the Nazis were defeated.  Hoch continued to produce her artwork until her 
		death in 1978, enjoying a successful career that lasted six decades. 
		</p>
		<h4 class="Apar">“Most of our male colleagues continued for a long while to look upon us as charming and gifted amateurs, 
		denying us implicitly any real professional status.” – Hannah Hoch</h4>
